# Store-Catalog-Project-in-Python

This project was meant to create a 7-class home appliance catalog program.

- must generate 4 attributes (price, consumption, manufacturer and product_code)
- populate a global variable with a list of objects for each object created
- to allow the sorting of objects from the global list by price or consumption
- it must generate two class variables called class and subclass that represents the class of equipment (eg "small appliances" or “Large appliances”) and equipment subclass (ex “mixer”). They will be used to find all objects of a certain class / subclass in global object list.
- allow all objects from a manufacturer to be displayed
